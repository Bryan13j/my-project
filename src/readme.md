Wherever we look nowadays, we see people wearing headphones or earbuds. They are becoming increasingly popular with the younger generation
 for work and for leisure. However, a new report from the BBC suggests noise-cancelling earphones could lead to hearing loss. 
 The BBC interviewed doctors and audiologists (hearing specialists) at audiology departments in five UK hospitals.
  The doctors told reporters they are seeing many young people who are finding it more and more difficult to process sounds. 
  The young patients say they can hear sounds, but they're often not sure where the sounds are coming from. 
  The doctors say noise-cancelling earphones could be the problem.
